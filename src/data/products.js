      'The Pixel 5 is unassuming. Instead of pushing the state of the art forward, Google has seemingly retreated to simpler, more reliable, and less expensive technology. The Pixel 4 had face unlock, squeezable sides, and a literal radar chip. The Pixel 5 has a simple rear-mounted fingerprint sensor that harkens back to Android phones from 2018, not 2020.And yet, it’s still a very good phone for $699. It’s not impressive or flashy. By spending just a little (or a lot) more money, you can get better specs, larger camera arrays, prettier screens, and fancier designs. The Pixel 5 is trying to sell something else, sometimes to a fault',

      "Canon EOS DSLR cameras have been my personal choice for over 15 years. These quality-built cameras deliver incredible image quality, are very easy to use (including great menu systems) and can be relied upon to bring home the prized picture. The huge range of compatible lenses, flashes and other accessories makes Canon a top choice of photographers ranging from mothers and fathers (and kids) up to the highest-paid professionals in the business.Canon's support system (in the US at least) is second to none. If you have a serious repair need, or simply need help using your camera, Canon is there for you.",

      "While camera stabilisation systems are getting better, the truth is that with megapixel counts getting higher, ensuring your shots are pin-sharp counts for a lot. And this means making sure you have a tripod. So the question is, which one are you going to pick? There are lots of different factors that go into picking a tripod. How much does your gear weigh – are you using a light camera and a short lens, or a heavy DSLR with a bulky telephoto? The last thing you want is the whole setup collapsing! There's also the weight of the tripod itself; you don't want to be carrying anything too heavy if you're off on a ten-mile romp through the Peak District or packing something into hand luggage for a flight.",

      "If I had to pick one denim brand to wear for the rest of my life, it would probably be Levi’s. Personally, I find their denim to be some of the most pear-friendly out there. Their Mile High Skinny Jeans were legit the first pair of jeans I ever bought that didn’t have a waist gap when I put them on. It felt like a small miracle in my books! Another thing that I love about Levi’s jeans is that they use a men’s sizing scale. This gives you so many more options to choose from compared to most size scales for women's jeans. This is how men's sizing works if you are not already familiar: the first number listed is the waist measurement and the second number listed is the inseam (or length measurement). Typically Levi’s offers women's waist sizes from 24’’ – 34’’ and inseam lengths of 28’’, 30’’, 32’’ and 34’’, which gives you more flexibility to find one that will work well for your body type.",

      'The iPhone 12 is the kind of product Apple only releases once in a while — the kind that looks different, is built on a fundamentally new technology, and will ultimately form the basis of future iPhones for years to come.It’s fortunate, then, that the new iPhone that most people will probably buy is also mostly a success. The iPhone 12 has an attractive new design, a straightforward and complete approach to 5G, good cameras and even better performance. But an iPhone of all trades is a master of none, and thus, the iPhone 12 isn’t perfect, either. A low amount of base storage and the lack of a charger included in box means this iPhone isn’t as inexpensive as it may initially seem. Additionally, some of the best features coming out of the Android realm, like super-sharp digital zoom and fast-refresh rate displays, are missing in action here.',

      'You certainly can spend a lot more for a winter jacket, but we love the combination of quality and value offered by the McMurdo Parka from The North Face. This parka covers all of the important bases: it’s warm, waterproof, blocks the wind, and is decently breathable for use in milder temperatures. In addition, we appreciate the upper-thigh-length cut, which offers good coverage while still allowing for plenty of mobility. And at $349, the McMurdo will set you back considerably less than many of the more expensive parka options below.What are the shortcomings of The North Face McMurdo Parka? It has a decidedly casual look and feel, meaning that it isn’t designed for the backcountry. In addition, you won’t get the same warmth for the weight or compressibility as some of the pricier jackets on the list that use thinner shells and 800-fill down or higher. But these shouldn’t be huge issues for around-town use, which is exactly why many people buy the McMurdo.',

      'The final JavaScript book I use each year is David Herman’s Effective JavaScript. I like this book because he also dives into how to use JavaScript by explaining the syntax in an easy, approachable manner. He covers common language constructs, like how variables and functions work, and why they work differently than other C based languages. Before he dives into teaching the language, he covers different aspects of it that might trip up a new JavaScript developer coming from another language. I appreciate the chapter on library and API design. This is something I do on a regular basis. The guidelines he shares still serve as my model for how I design my own applications. Since applications are really a collection of libraries and patterns, it is important to understand how to craft your code to be as efficient and maintainable as possible. Herman’s guidelines will give you a common foundation for building small and large applications. I can testify. I have built 100s over the past decade.',
